Welcome to my first tech blog! 🚀  
 
This blog is built using **Jekyll and GitHub Pages**, and here I’ll be sharing insights on:
 
- AWS & Azure
- Cost Optimization
- Cloud Architecture
- Real-world DevOps problems
 
## Why I Started This Blog
 
As a cloud engineer working on:
- AWS CUR
- Athena
- Batch jobs
- Node.js automation
 
I wanted a space to document and share what I learn in a practical, no-fluff way.
 
## What's Coming Next?
 
- Azure Spot VMs deep dive  
- Athena cost optimization tricks  
- Reserved Instances vs Savings Plans  
- Cloud memes 😄
 
Stay tuned!
